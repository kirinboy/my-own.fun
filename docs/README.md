**TL;DR** The gru.ai is a prototype of On-Device AI Agent, run in browser as an extension.

## Project Goal
**For:** Geeky application software engineers

**Who:** Want to build intelligent applications for themselves or others, but there seems to be a lot to learn that holds them back, such as various AI models, knowledge graphs, MLOps, LLMOps, etc. Meanwhile, many of them are extremely care about the privacy.

**The** gru.ai

**IS A** Prototype of frontend AI agent (on device AI agent).

**THAT** Provide an examples of how to build intelligent applications with minimal AI knowledge and simple technology, it can be quickly adopted to other projects.

**UNLIKE** ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Kimi, [Sider.AI](https://sider.ai/), [Monica AI](https://monica.im/), and other AI assistants.

**OUR PRODUCT** is focusing on On-Device AI Agent (which is a complex intelligent application), and make software engineers easier to learn and build their own applications.

## Why Frontend AI Agent

1. **Trend:** The AI Agent is shifting the way of working.
2. **Audience:** The majority of the application software engineers are frontend engineers or fullstack engineers.
3. **Need:** Both individuals & enterprises need proprietary AI solution to protect data security.
4. **Experience:** On-Device AI Agent is better than AI assistant (QA bot) for productivity.
5. **Wide Adoption:** Many of Web apps are legacy system, the browser extension is the cheaper way to upgrade them with AI.
6. **Feasible:** As long as you have a PC, you can start learning & building intelligent application.

### Differentiation
***Frontend AI Agent are the embodied intelligence of the World Wide Web.***
1. The browser is the eye of Web, the AI Agent can see the web pages*.
2. The AI Agent can interact with multiple web pages, like a human.

| Perspective     | gru.ai (Frontend AI Agent)       | AI PC & AI Phone                            | AI Agent in Professional Software | Backend AI Agent                   |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Privacy**     | Under control                    | The best they can do is Siri                | Out of control                    | You can trust what you build       |
| **Experience**  | It can see more than you can see | It's harder to get information from browser | Depends on use cases              | You need to told them              |
| **Flexible & Extendable** | It could be anything you want    | Limited by the OEM                          | Limited by the software           | Limited by the runtime environment |

Compare with other AI assistants, the On-Device AI Agent in browser has below advantages:
1. It can get screenshot of current web page, it can use multimodal AI model to understand the content.
2. It can get the html DOM of web page, the AI model can understand better with sim-structured text data.
3. It can get information from multiple web pages, it can provide more accurate information.
4. User can choose any AI model compatible with OpenAI. If user choose Ollama, all the data is under control.

At last, the code are open sourced, user can check the code and build their own AI Agent.

### In the Plan
In the future, we plan to have more features, such as:
* Explore local backend service to support ChatPDF, RAG, Knowledge Based QA, etc.
* Native AI: Explore the possibility of using WebAssembly to run AI model in browser.
* AI Agent: Understand the web page, and operate the web page like a human.

It also in order to help software engineers to learn and build intelligent applications.

## Call for Participation
The gru.ai is an open source project for geek application software engineers, we welcome all kinds of contributions.

### For More Frontend Engineers
* Wait for your contribution to support Vue.js.

### For Firefox & Edge Fans
* Wait for your contribution to support Firefox & Edge.
