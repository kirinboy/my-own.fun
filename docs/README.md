**TL;DR** The gru.ai is a prototype of On-Device AI Agent, run in browser as an extension.

## Project Goal
**For:** Geeky application software engineers

**Who:** Want to build intelligent applications for themselves or others, but there seems to be a lot to learn that holds them back, such as various AI models, knowledge graphs, MLOps, LLMOps, etc. Meanwhile, many of them are extremely care about the privacy.

**The** gru.ai

**IS A** Prototype of On Device AI agent.

**THAT** Provide an examples of how to build intelligent applications with minimal AI knowledge and simple technology, it can be quickly adopted to other projects.

**UNLIKE** ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Kimi, [Sider.AI](https://sider.ai/), [Monica AI](https://monica.im/), and other AI assistants.

**OUR PRODUCT** is focusing on On-Device AI Agent (which is a complex intelligent application), and make software engineers easier to learn and build their own applications.
